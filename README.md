# ExerciseDBT: Project Report     Andrea MACHEDA

In the context of this project, we had the opportunity to delve into the realm of Analytics Engineering using DBT (Data Build Tool), PostgreSQL, and Metabase. This hands-on experience allowed us to establish a comprehensive data pipeline, from data importation to visualization of insights.

## Background

The ExerciseDBT project presented us with a set of tasks representative of real-world challenges encountered in the realm of data analytics. We were tasked with creating a data pipeline from scratch, utilizing the specified tools and technologies. This included setting up a development environment, processing raw data, modeling the data, and ultimately creating visualizations to extract meaningful insights.

## Objectives

Our main objective was to understand and put into practice key concepts of analytics engineering, including:

- Data manipulation using DBT to transform it into actionable models.
- Using PostgreSQL as a database to store our transformed data.
- Creating interactive visualizations in Metabase to present our findings effectively.

## Approach

We followed a methodical approach to achieve our objectives:

1. **Setting Up the DBT Project**: We began by configuring our development environment, installing necessary dependencies, and initializing our DBT project.

2. **Processing Raw Data**: Using the provided CSV files, we seeded raw data into our PostgreSQL database, laying the groundwork for subsequent data transformation steps.

3. **Data Modeling**: We created staging models to structure our raw data into actionable insights. This involved transforming sales and product data into normalized models.

4. **Data Aggregation**: Mart models were created to aggregate data and generate meaningful insights. We calculated daily sales volume and daily revenue by category to facilitate analysis.

5. **Visualization Creation with Metabase**: We utilized Metabase to create interactive visualizations from our modeled data. This included daily and monthly sales trends, sales distribution by category, and category performance over time.

6. **Sharing Work**: Finally, we shared our work by initializing a Git repository and pushing our project to GitHub, enabling collaboration and showcasing our analytical skills.

## Conclusion

The ExerciseDBT project provided us with valuable hands-on experience in the field of analytics engineering. By navigating through the challenges of creating a comprehensive data pipeline, we strengthened our understanding of essential tools and processes for handling and analyzing large-scale data. We are confident that the skills acquired in this project will be valuable in our future endeavors in analytics and data processing.
